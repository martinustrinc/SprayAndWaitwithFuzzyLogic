# Spray and Wait with Fuzzy Logic
The Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) Simulator 1.4.1

This project aims to test the simulation of human network connection deployment using One Simulator (The ONE v1.4.1) by utilizing the Spray and Wait Algorithm and Fuzzy Logic method.

What is The ONE?
The ONE is a Opportunistic Network Environment simulator which provides a
powerful tool for generating mobility traces, running DTN messaging
simulations with different routing protocols, and visualizing both
simulations interactively in real-time and results after their completion.

This project is using Java Programming Language.
